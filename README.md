# Reusable-Workflows
Base workflows to reduce duplicate code in FullStackIndie workflows. These have been made public merely for reference points/examples for you own reusable workflows
and not neccessarily to be called by your own repos

## Important!!!
These workflows are not completely reuasble outside of FullStackIndie repos. Most of the workflosw have variables/secrets and inputs that can be changed according to
the repos that call them but some things are hardcoded as of right now such as DockerHub repo where docker images get published.
